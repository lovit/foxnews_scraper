Francis said \"partial solutions can't be given to such a universal question.\"\nHe praised Colombia for accepting a large number of people fleeing Venezuela's economic difficulties.\nThe pope voiced dismay Monday over long-running conflicts in Ukraine and in Syria, and praised dialogue between North and South Korea.\nFrancis also warned against an accelerating arms race."
