End of. The body of a 25-year-old woman is extraordinary. The body of a woman of 50 is not extraordinary at all,” he said\n\"I prefer younger women's bodies, that's all. End of. The body of a 25-year-old woman is extraordinary. The body of a woman of 50 is not extraordinary at all.\"\nBIGGEST CELEBRITY SOCIAL MEDIA BLUNDERS OF 2018\nHe also added that he prefers Asian women, particularly from China, Korea, and Japan.\n“It's perhaps sad and reductive for the women I go out with but the Asian type is sufficiently rich, large and infinite for me not to be ashamed,” he added.\nFew were receptive to Moix’s comments, with most women slamming and mocking the author. “Can women under 50 be invisible to you too please?” one social media user wrote.\nAnother social media user said his comments were a “breathing a sigh of relief” to women over 50.\nFrench comedian Marina Fois joked that she has only “more than 1 year and 14 days to sleep with #yannmoix #inchallah it is done” as she’s about to turn 49 years old.\nRICKY GERVAIS SLAMMED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AFTER TWEET COMES OFF AS DEFENSE OF LOUIS C.K.\nAnother comedian, Anne Roumanoff, wished the author one day understands that romance “isn’t just about the firmness of the buttocks” and about the connection with another person.\nThe comments even drew the attention of lawmakers, with French MP Olivia Gregoire, a spokesman for President Emmanuel Macron's En Marche! Party, mocking the author: “Very classy Yann Moix. Very very classy.”\nMoix defended his comments on French radio station RTL, saying he’s a “prisoner” of his taste in women.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n“I don’t see this as pride, but almost as a curse. It’s not my fault. We are not responsible for our tastes, our penchants, our inclinations. I’m not here to hold forth on this,” he told the radio.\n“Every individual is a prisoner of their tastes. I'm a prisoner of mine. It takes nothing away from a woman of 50 years that I don't want to sleep with her,” he added."
