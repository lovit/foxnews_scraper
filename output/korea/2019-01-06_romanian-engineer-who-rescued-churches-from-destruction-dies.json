The urban redesign was inspired during a 1971 visit to North Korea.\nIordachescu devised a radical system to place whole buildings on the equivalent of railway tracks and roll them hundreds of meters (yards) away to save them from destruction.\nIn 2016, the church awarded him the \"Patriarchal Cross,\" its highest honor for laypeople."
