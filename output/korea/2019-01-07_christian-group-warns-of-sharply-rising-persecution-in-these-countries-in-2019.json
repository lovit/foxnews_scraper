You have militant Islam in Nigeria; China, which is communism; India, which is militant Hinduism; North Korea which is a weird blend of communism and Emporer worship. There is an increasing intolerance and it’s being played out in violence and we know it because of the reports that are coming from our partners on the ground.\"\nCHRISTIAN PERSECUTION CONTINUES TO RISE, MORE INCIDENTS AGAINST WOMEN IN 2017, NEW REPORT SAYS\nOther countries of specific concern for 2019 include North Korea, Eritrea, and Pakistan, where Christian Asia Bibi is still not free to leave, despite being acquitted of blasphemy.\nAbednego Solomon was 10 years-old when he was slashed by Fulani militants who attacked his village in Nigera.\n      (Andrew Boyd)\nIn Nigeria, Fulani militants look set to continue devastating attacks against Christians in the north and central Nigeria. In the first six months of 2018 alone, they killed up to 6,000 and drove 50,000 from their homes.\n“So if you take Nigeria, everybody knows about Boko Haran, but hugely unreported are Fulani militants, Muslim herdsman, being armed and they are attacking Christian villages in the north of the country and the tactics that they are using appear to be well coordinated and planned,” Boyd said, adding they are a \"much, much more serious menace than Boko Haran.\"\nIn one particular example, \"the Fulani would fire shots at night and lie in wait with machetes for them – these are men, women, and children – we’re dealing with lots of orphans, some of them who are heavily scarred…and the government seems to be doing very little.\"\nChurch demolished by the Chinese authorities in Pingyang County, Wenzhou, in April 2014. Photo: China Aid.\nChina has seen a sharp increase in government opposition to religion, including Christianity, as the Chinese government has destroyed crosses, burned Bibles, closed churches, and is forcing believers to sign papers renouncing their faith in Beijing and several other provinces, demanding loyalty to the atheist Communist party in power.\n\"Tough new laws were brought in 2018, and we’ve seen high profile unregistered churches, house churches, are now being closed down,\" Boyd said. \"Our partners are saying the Chinese government is now emboldened because of the lack of protests from the West.\"\nOne of their partners said the government is trying to \"reduce Christianity to just a minor activity by unimportant older people.\"\nIndian Christians hold placards protesting against attacks on churches in the Indian capital as they assemble outside the Sacred Heart Church in New Delhi, India.\n      (The Associated Press)\nIn India, attacks against Christians are coming from Hindu nationalists that are on the rise. They see no place for Muslims or Christians in India and has only been emboldened since the government of India Prime Minister Narendra Modi took power in 2014, the group said.\nThere has been a rise in attacks on pastors and prayer meetings being broken up, as several states in the nation are passing anti-conversion laws. One pastor told Release he was thrown off a moving train for carrying Bibles in a rucksack. His attackers yelled, \"These people are spoiling our religion!\" and threw him on to the platform. They fractured his skull, shoulder bone, and ankle, and knocked out several teeth. The pastor continues to preach the gospel despite opposition from hard-liners, the group said.\nRelease International is providing Bibles in local languages to replace those the militants destroy and is giving vital legal aid and support to pastors who have been arrested.\nBoyd said the United States could make a difference.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"The United States is so important. When the U.S. declares a country of particular concern the world sits up and takes notice,\" he said. \"Your role really matters when it comes to religious persecution. You give out a message that the world is watching.\"\nCHRISTIANS IN SINGAPORE, KOREA PRAY THE TRUMP-KIM SUMMIT RESULTS IN 'WORLD PEACE'\nYou can read the Release International's full review here."
